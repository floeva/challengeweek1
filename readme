# First Challenge Week 1

## Description

We needed to refractor the code already written to make it accessible and get the code of excess code, 
we did this in order to practice the skills we have learnt so far
with the programming languages HTML and CSS, i solved the problem of unlable sections replacing div with semantic HTML 
in  order to clean up the code and make it easier for anyone who encounters the code next, 
i learnt how the html affects CSS and the diffrence between class & id and how to refactor. also to autosave that really helped complete the project.
